This analysis script merges several datasets from the repository (Test, Training, Activity ID , and Subject ID).  The mean and standard deviaiton were extracted from the data sets.  Labels for each of the columns were set to make them more meaningful and a tidy dataset was created.  A text file (SmartphoneActivityData.txt) was created from this dataset and exported to the working directory.
